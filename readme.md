# Default Scroll

A Firefox extension to block pages from messing with the scroll behaviour (scroll jacking, smooth scrolling).

It is rather aggressive, so it will probably break infinite scrolling, lazy loading and much more.
Functionality can be toggled per site using the toolbar button.

The extension works by blocking event listeners on the following events:
* scroll 
* mousewheel 
* dommousescroll 
* wheel

Install the extension from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/default-scroll/).
